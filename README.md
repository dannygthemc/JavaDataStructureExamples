# JavaDataStructureExamples

This is a collection of data structure implementations I created for projects throughout my undergrad.
The data structures are utilized to complete a variety of tasks such as image compression, solving mazes, solving Sudokus and more.
This is a reference resource for those attempting to implement data structures.
